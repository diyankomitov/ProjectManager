Overview:
The site is a group based real-time chat site that allows students to discuss class projects. A user can log on, create a project, add other users to the project and send messages in to the chat. The other users in the chat will then receive those messages when they log on.

Good points:
- Site supports multiple-user communication.
- Site allows for users to communicate with others in different chat rooms. 
- Site uses conventions seen in similar applications, so the way most features are intended to be used are ‘guessable’.
- Site auto-updates with new data so users do not need to refresh the page.
- All input is secured against SQL/JS injection.
- Site looks professional and user-friendly.
Weak points:
- There are longer page load times when message chains are very long since the ‘unlimited scrolling’ is not implemented.
- The site polls the database every 3 seconds and requests a lot of data.
- Some of the code could have been automated using SQL Triggers and other constraints.
